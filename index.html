<h1>PROJECTS</h1>
  <h2>Socket Programming and Client-Server Architecture</h2>
  <p>This project explains the use of sockets for communicating over the Internet. Ultimately an Overlay Network is formed and thus network communication can be experienced in the overlay. The objective is to learn to handle multiple clients with a Connectionless Iterative Server using UDP and Connection-oriented Concurrent Server using TCP for communication. Overlay Network is created using PlanetLab. PlanetLab is an open, globally distributed platform used for developing, deploying and accessing planetary-scale network services. </p>
 
  <h2>Simulation based Evaluation of Network Interface Card</h2>
  <p>The Network Interface Card (NIC) allows computers to communicate over a local-area network. A typical NIC is both a physical layer and data link layer device and provides access to the transmission medium, and supports a MAC protocol and an addressing scheme. This project helps in evaluating the performance of a NIC using an event-driven simulator.</p>
  
  <h2>Searching Contents in a Distributed Application-Layer Network</h2>
  <p>This project develops a solution to search for contents in a distributed system. A simple overlay solution is developed which allows a set of nodes to share resources among each other. A set of nodes is connected via some overlay topology. Each node has a set of files that it is willing to share with other nodes. A node in the system which is looking for a particular file issues a query to identify a node that contains the specific mentioned file. Once the node is identified, it can then be exchanged between the two nodes. The main goal is to generate network topology and design searching algorithms to locate interesting items.  </p>
  
  <h2>Implementation of Caching in Unstructured Peer to Peer Networks</h2>
  <p>Implements a caching mechanism in an overlay unstructured Peer to Peer network that allows a set of nodes to share as well as cache pointers to resources among each other. A set of nodes is connected via an unstructured P2P overlay topology. Each node has a set of files that it is willing to share with other nodes and each node has cache of size N which holds IP address pairs. This way the search query does not have to propogate all the way to the node with the contents. Thus, this project helps to develop an efficient solution to search for contents in a distributed system.</p>

  <h2>Distributed Hash Table Based Content Searching</h2>
  <p>This project develops a TCP based structured-overlay-based solution which allows to share contents amongst a set of nodes. Tha main goal is to support information discovery using a structured Peer to Peer overlay topology. An efficient solution is developed to search contents in a large distributed system. </p>
  
  <h2>Peer-to-Peer File Sharing Application Over Named Data Networking</h2>
  <p>This project explains how Named Data Networking can be used to support file sharing and synchronization without centralization. The application developed will exercise NDNs efficient multicast dissemination and intrinsic content signatures. It relies on NDNs content caching and multicast mechanism to achieve reduction in congestion as compared to IP-based P2P approaches.</p>
  
  <h2>A Bayesian approach for object classification based on clusters of SIFT local features</h2>
  <p>The project provides an efficient object classification for the objects in the images of the dataset by employing SIFT descriptors for feature identification around keypoint locations which uses hierarchical agglomerative method. Bayesian classifier is implemented to get the abstract object class that the object best fits into.</p>

  <h2>Automatic License Plate Recognition And Gate Opener using OCR</h2>
  <p>Implements a real time embedded system which is robust, thereby can be used for license plate recognition. The prototype developed works for wide variations in illumination conditions and various types of license plates. This model will serve as surveillance system which will help in preventing the entry of unregistered vehicles in the specificresidential building or offices.</p>
