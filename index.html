  <h2>Socket Programming and Client-Server Architecture</h2>
  <p>This project explains the use of sockets for communicating over the Internet. Ultimately an Overlay Network is formed and thus network communication can be experienced in the overlay. The objective is to learn to handle multiple clients with a Connectionless Iterative Server using UDP and Connection-oriented Concurrent Server using TCP for communication. Overlay Network is created using PlanetLab. PlanetLab is an open, globally distributed platform used for developing, deploying and accessing planetary-scale network services. </p>
 
  <h2>Simulation based Evaluation of Network Interface Card</h2>
  <p>The Network Interface Card (NIC) allows computers to communicate over a local-area network. A typical NIC is both a physical layer and data link layer device and provides access to the transmission medium, and supports a MAC protocol and an addressing scheme. This code helps in evaluating the performance of a NIC using an event-driven simulator.</p>
